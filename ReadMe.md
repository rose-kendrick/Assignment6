**Assignment 6**
+ Central.py
    + Central.py uses central differencing to calculate the derivative of 2+0.75*tan(2x) from x = [-2,2] the outputs plotted. This calculation is run using multiple step sizes, dx = [1, 0.5, 0.1].
+ Potential.py
    + Potential.py calculates and plots the potential over a square, 0.2m grid with two point charges, one positive and one negative. It then calculates the Electrical field using the partial derivatives with respect to x and y of the potential function, the results displayed on a plot.
